How to add a class to the viewer!

You need a c++ class.  Checkout RecoViewer/template/empty.h and .cxx.
These classes can be copied and modified to make your own class.

If you want to draw a few things together, like tracks/showers and vertexes,
definitely look at the c++ class for drawing the individual object.  There
is frequently a function that will convert the larlite data product into the 
evd data product that you need, and you can call that function from your
own c++ code.  This will simplify your life.

In python, you need a class like the one below to manage interface with the c++
framework and the Qt based gui.  This class owns the instance of the c++ process
but that process is called from elsewhere.  The function drawObjects is called
with each new drawing iteration and it fetches the data from the process and
manipulates it into a reasonable screen rendering.

ALL UNITS IN THE VIEW ARE WIRE/TIMETICK.  This is because fractional time ticks or 
wires are challenging as pixels.  You can draw objects in fractional places, however.
There is nothing wrong with a vertex projected to a location of 45.3 wires and 1203.7 ticks.

When you have made your c++ class, and it compiles, you should add it to the linkdef
file too.  Then make your python class.  Add your python class to the __init__.py module definition.

Lastly, add your class to the drawableItems file with a line like this:
        self._drawableClasses.update({'MyProduct': [empty.empty,"myprod"]})

The first argument, in quotes, is the name that will appear in the viewer.  The list
is a reference to the class you made (below), so it's file.class and an instance will
be created when a user requests this class be drawn.  The final object is the larlite
data product that gets drawn.

In general, don't push your changes to the event display without talking to Corey Adams first.
